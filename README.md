## About Video Downloader

A 3D audio visualizer I created while exploring / experimenting the Three.js library.

Unfortunately, it ran terribly with my screen recorder running on my machine. Animations are smoother in regular use.

## Getting Started
Download the files and open the index.html file! Upload an mp3 file and watch immerse yourself in my visualizer. Enjoy :)
